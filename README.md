## Game Idea

# Rapid Roll (Final Idea)
![Rapid-roll-image](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-14/blob/main/images/rapid-roll.jpg)

This is a one-player platform game where players control a ball that continuously rolls down a series of platforms without dying. There will be 3 levels, easy, medium and hard and they reflect the speed of the ball as it falls, making the game more challenging. Furthermore, based on how many coins the player collects while playing, it will translate to getting more lives, therefore increasing one's score. Likewise, the platforms will have spikes and be generative, adding further complexity and challenge to the game.

**Twist**: Instead of a static maze, there is an option to select a dynamic environment which involves platforms shifting and new obstacles appearing to add an extra layer of challenge. 

Challenges:
- Generative Platforming 
- Optimisation for Smooth Gameplay
- Collision Detection and Spikes
